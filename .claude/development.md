## üîÑ CI/CD & GitHub Actions Architecture

The project uses a **modular reusable actions architecture** with smart caching for optimal performance and maintainability.

### Reusable Actions Pattern

**Two-Layer Composite Action Structure**:

- **Foundation Layer**: Base actions for common setup (Node.js, pnpm, dependencies)
- **Specialized Layer**: Domain-specific actions that build on foundation actions
- **Benefits**: Maximum reusability, consistent environments, reduced duplication

### Caching Strategy

**Intelligent Version-Based Caching**:

- Cache keys include tool versions for proper invalidation
- Expensive operations (browser downloads) are cached, lightweight ones are not
- Cache hit detection prevents redundant installations
- `actions/cache@v4` handles both restore and save phases automatically

### Workflow Design Principles

- **Focused Scope**: Each workflow has a single, clear purpose
- **Manual Triggers**: Maintenance operations use `workflow_dispatch`
- **Smart Execution**: Conditional steps based on cache hits and change detection
- **Artifact Strategy**: Upload generated files for review and debugging
- **Commit Discipline**: Semantic commits with `[skip ci]` for automated changes

## üîê Security

- Validate all server-side inputs (API routes)
- Use HTTPS-only cookies and CSRF tokens when applicable
- Protect sensitive routes with middleware or session logic

## üîç Documentation & Onboarding

- Each component and hook should include a short comment on usage
- Document top-level files (like `src/app/layout.tsx`) and configs
- Keep `README.md` up to date with getting started, design tokens, and component usage notes
- Do not add comments for self-explanatory code
- When adding a comment, ensure it explains WHY the code is written in a certain way - NOT WHAT IT DOES

## MISC

- The owner of the portfolio is "Jordy van Vorselen", use this name everywhere instead of "Alex Johnson"
- Write ONE small test at a time. Run it. Make it pass with the simplest code possible. Then write the next test.
- **Image URLs**: Always use Unsplash images in mock data and test fixtures. Never use `example.com` or other domains that aren't configured in `next.config.js`
